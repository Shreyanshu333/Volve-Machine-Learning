# Volve-Machine-Learning

**Scope of the Project**:ðŸ‘‡

1) To build prediction models to determine the Bore Oil Volume of a test well.\
2) To understand the interdependencies of the different variables in the dataset.\
3) To apply basic concepts of production engineering on real field dataset.

**About Volve**:

The Volve field in the Norwegian North Sea: 2008â€”2016.\
The Volve oil field, was decommissioned in September 2016 after 8.5 years in operation, more than twice as long as originally planned. 
The development was based on production from the MÃ¦rsk Inspirer jack-up rig, with Navion Saga used as a storage ship to hold crude oil before export. Gas was piped to the Sleipner A platform for final processing and export. Volve reached a recovery rate of 54% and in March 2016 the licence decided to shut down its production permanently. The field was originally scheduled for 3-5 years of operation. 
At plateau Volve produced some 56,000 barrels per day and delivered a total of 63 million barrels. 



Location: About 200 kilometres west of Stavanger at the southern end of the Norwegian sector
Production start: 12 February 2008\
Production end: 17 September 2016\
Production: Oil
